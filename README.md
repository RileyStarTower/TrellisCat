# TrellisCat
TrellisCat is a writing tool centered around the structure of the narrative rather than the text. The narrative is outlined 
in a hierarchy of increasing detail; for example, going from the major plot points, to the individual scenes, down to 
individual paragraphs.

The goal is to make it easier to construct a narrative with a robust outline, without getting bogged down in the details of writing prose.

As of June 2018, the project is still in an extremely early state.
